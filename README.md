This is mainly used as a demo project for an article I wrote on our blog:

## How to use

Clone this repository on your computer and then run:

```
npm install
```

I've written some scripts in the package.json file to make it all work:

- io:serve : To test the app in your browser
- ios:serve : To test the app in an iPhone emulator
- ios:build : To build the Xcode project
- android:serve : To test the app in an Android emulator
- android:build : To build the Android app
- android:install : To install the Android app on an emulator or an Android device connected to your computer
